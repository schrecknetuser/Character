Clan Bane
You must spend the day by your chosen charge, by
whatever it is you rule. If you do not, you sustain 3
aggravated Willpower damage upon waking the
following night.
Clan Compulsion
Covetousness
You become obsessed with possessing something in
the scene, desiring to add it to your proverbial
hoard. This can be anything from an object to a
piece of property to an actual person. Any action
not taken toward this purpose incurs a two-dice
penalty. The Compulsion persists until ownership is
established (the Storyteller decides what
constitutes ownership in the case of a non-object)
or the object of desire becomes unattainable.
