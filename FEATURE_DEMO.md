# Session Change Logging Feature Demo

This document demonstrates how the new session change logging feature works.

## Before the Change
When a user opened the data screen and changed the session count, no record was kept of this change in the character's change log.

## After the Change  
When a user opens the data screen, changes the session count, and closes the screen:

### Example 1: Session Increment
```
1. User opens Data screen (current session: 3)
2. User taps the + button (session becomes 4) 
3. User taps "Done" to close screen
4. System logs: "Session changed from 3 to 4" with timestamp
5. Character is updated in store
```

### Example 2: Session Decrement
```
1. User opens Data screen (current session: 5)
2. User taps the - button twice (session becomes 3)
3. User taps "Done" to close screen  
4. System logs: "Session changed from 5 to 3" with timestamp
5. Character is updated in store
```

### Example 3: No Change
```
1. User opens Data screen (current session: 2)
2. User views the change log but doesn't modify session
3. User taps "Done" to close screen
4. No log entry is created (no spam)
```

## Technical Implementation
- DataModalView now tracks the initial session count when opened
- On "Done" button press, compares current vs initial session
- If different, creates a ChangeLogEntry and updates the character
- Uses the existing CharacterStore.updateCharacter() method for persistence
- Backwards compatible - store parameter is optional

## User Experience
- Users can now see a history of when sessions were modified
- Change log shows clear, readable messages like "Session changed from 3 to 4"
- Timestamps allow tracking when changes occurred
- Works consistently across all character types (Vampire, Ghoul, Mage)
